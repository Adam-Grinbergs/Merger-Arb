## Introduction

Aside from moonlighting as a highschool teacher, Bobby Lillo is a trader. It's in his blood. He can sense a change in basis points the same way his friends claim to be able to sense changes in emotions during a social interaction. 

He has identified an amazing new strategy, based on hours of careful research on Investopedia. He'll play M&A and profit off that sweet spread. But what's this, sometimes M&A deals don't go through? Eventually he's going to get margin called? Nonsense, just unwind the position and have another Jones Soda&copy;Â 

He remembers his mother telling him at young age that if he became a soldier, he'd be a general; if he was a priest, he'd be the Pope. But he was a trader, and became **Bobby**.
