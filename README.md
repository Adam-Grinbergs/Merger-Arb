# Mining-Deal-League
Mining Deal League is an effort to use Natural Language Processing (via Explosion.ai's Spacy library) to create a league table tracking financing activities for junior mining companies. This will be hosted on Heroku and display some visualizations of both the companies who have raised the most money through financing, but also how the industry as a whole tends towards succesful capital sourcing activities. 

## The App:
You can find the app at PUT LINK HERE WHEN FINISHED WITH PROJECT

## Features:
- Shows total financing raised by junior mining companies
- Automatically adds new deals as they are reported daily on Junior Mining Network
- Visualizes the success of the junior mining industry as a whole for fundraising

## Todo:
1. Body: Include the full article instead of just title.
2. Financing Type: Train a named entity to recognize equity/debt/hybrid deals. Could later expand to capture things like royalties and more granular info about the deal.
3. Lender: Sometimes companies report some participants of the financing. Would be interesting to create a Lenders database to go with this one.
