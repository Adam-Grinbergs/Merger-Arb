Mining Deal League is an effort to use Natural Language Processing (via Explosion.ai's Spacy library) to create a league table tracking financing activities for junior mining companies. This will be hosted on Heroku and display some visualizations of both the companies who have raised the most money through financing, but also how the industry as a whole tends towards succesful capital sourcing activities. 

## The App:
You can find the app at I WILL PUT LINK HERE WHEN FINISHED WITH PROJECT

## Features:
- Shows total financing raised by junior mining companies
- Automatically adds new deals as they are reported daily on Junior Mining Network
- Visualizes the success of the junior mining industry as a whole for fundraising

1. Clean up SQL database (replace borrower with tagged name, remove f_amt)
2. Make Flask app automatically scrape
2. Choose JS Charting framework and build site
